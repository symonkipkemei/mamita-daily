# mamita_daily

Mamita daily is a term coined  by Michael Kiilu and I , back in the university of Nairobi when we were fantasizing on how possible it is to make ($100,000) daily. Yes,I believe this is possible. Financial freedom is a lifestyle and more importantly an informed lifestyle.

Mamita daily is a CRUD (create, read, update and delete) app that manages all investments,savings,odinary and business accounts in one place.
The app is modeled based on the premise that financial freedom is more of a lifestyle than a one time affair.

Mamita daily :
- Balances investment portfolio
- Automates investments
- Automates salaries
- Automates savings
- Monitors business accounts
- Tracks personal expenditures
